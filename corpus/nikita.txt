We were split into groups and provided an poorly-made (on-purpose) app. Our task was to fix the UX issues with the app. We were given 15 minutes to finalize the concept and 20 more minutes to make changes. Each group had a coach to consult. Unlike previous group activity this one was even more pressure filled. We could not coordinate well to fix all aspects of UX. @peterlubbers @udacity @SebastianThrun @rockylubbers @seanlubbers maybe you guys need a #PingPongBasicsND
