@AdedanaAbroad Thanks! Just getting the hang of this and overcoming my social media Ludditism.
@AdedanaAbroad interesting, so reply is only for mutual followers?
Well look at that. Thanks Addy.
Twitter is weird.
Squawker is weird.
Why am I so driven to get points? Just spent my weekend on Stackoverflow.
@TellMeMoreNPR @PeaceCorps #TechKobwa had 10 classes from touch typing to prog. Girls have gone back to create comp clubs at school #NPRWIT

Anyone want to (or already) going to see Penguin Prison Feb 10th in the city? Just bought tickets. Jeff Geoff...(apparently the only people I can think of in the city are named Jeff)
@okaycoder @udacity @jpsouchak @puf Sweet app and love that you're using Firebase and the Movie DB api. Thanks for sharing!
 Thank you! This made my day!

If anyone was wondering where I was early June, it was teaching mobile app development (thanks to Udacity) to the brilliant and ambitious students at Asian University For Women!

Hey friends - My team is looking for some women (or just generally more diverse backgrounds) to be interviewed as part of a free online introductory Java programming course I'm helping develop. If you work or have worked with Java, want to inspire some beginners to learn java and are not completely allergic to cameras, let me know! The interview questions are things like : Why did you learn Java and What's the coolest thing you made with Java?
Finally opened that arduino kit...
I'm apparently collecting siblings in NorCal
Hah...this might be the exact moment I decided to slowly, and with a lot of apologizing, go for Ben's jugular.
Pretty excited about Udacity's new product and expanded customer base #Pawdacity
Life is good. We have until the 15th to find roommates for my dream house (and we're looking for 5 now so the price is a little less aneurysm inducing), we finally moved out and got all the checks for asbestos house (thank you Lira), and I'm off to Nicaragua. I...I think I can relax now?
